## What We're Working On Next

**NEW: PostgreSQL + GCP Migration Sprint**

### Current Focus: Database Migration Architecture 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
- 📋 **Status**: Planning complete, ready to implement
- 🎯 **Goal**: Migrate from Parquet-only to PostgreSQL + GCP Cloud Storage
- 📄 **Documents**:
  - Requirements: `construction/requirements/postgresql-migration-requirements.md`
  - Design: `construction/design/postgresql-migration-design.md`
  - Sprint Plan: `construction/sprints/sprint-postgresql-migration.md`
  - ADRs: `memory-bank/architectural-decisions.md`

**Why This Migration:**
1. **Performance**: 10-100x faster API queries with indexed database
2. **Scalability**: Support 100+ intersections and concurrent users
3. **Spatial Features**: PostGIS enables proximity, routing, heatmaps
4. **Production Ready**: Cloud storage (GCS) instead of local Docker volumes
5. **Data Management**: Automated aggregation, retention, lifecycle policies

**Architecture:**
```
VCC API → Data Collector → Dual Write
                             ├─→ GCS (raw Parquet archives)
                             └─→ PostgreSQL + PostGIS (operational queries)
                                      ↓
                                  FastAPI (10-100x faster)
                                      ↓
                                  Frontend (no changes)
```

**Key Technologies:**
- PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS 3.3 for operational database
- GCP Cloud Storage for raw data archival (Parquet)
- Dual-write during migration for zero downtime
- Time partitioning for performance
- Automated aggregation jobs (hourly, daily)

**Timeline:** 4 weeks (80-100 hours)
**Cost:** ~$35/month for GCS (PostgreSQL free in Docker)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve migration plan
2. Begin Phase 1: Database setup (Days 1-3)
3. Phase 2: GCP Cloud Storage setup (Days 4-5)
4. Phase 3: Dual-write implementation (Days 6-8)
5. Phase 4: API migration (Days 9-12)
6. Phase 5: Batch jobs (Days 13-15)
7. Phase 6: Historical backfill (Days 16-18)
8. Phase 7: Cutover (Days 19-20)

### Future Focus: Data Integration & Extensibility Roadmap
- 📋 **Status**: Planning complete, deferred until after PostgreSQL migration
- 🎯 **Goal**: Transform from VCC-only to multi-source pluggable platform
- 📄 **Document**: `memory-bank/data-integration-roadmap.md`

**Key Initiatives** (postponed):
1. **Pluggable Data Source Architecture** - Allow easy addition of new data sources (weather, crash data, traffic)
2. **Configurable Safety Index** - Make features and weights adjustable without code changes
3. **Admin UI** - Build dashboard for data analysis and index tuning
4. **Multi-source Integration** - Add weather, VDOT crash data, traffic volume sources

**Timeline**: 4-6 months (15-20 weeks development)
**Phases**: 6 phases from plugin framework to A/B testing
**Status**: Deferred until PostgreSQL migration complete

---

## What Decisions Are We Facing?

### 1. **PostgreSQL + GCP Migration Approval** 🔥 URGENT - NEW
- **Status**: Planning complete, ready to implement
- **Documents**:
  - `construction/requirements/postgresql-migration-requirements.md`
  - `construction/design/postgresql-migration-design.md`
  - `construction/sprints/sprint-postgresql-migration.md`
  - `memory-bank/architectural-decisions.md`
- **Key Decisions Needed**:
  - ✅ **Approve hybrid storage architecture?** (PostgreSQL + GCP Cloud Storage)
  - ✅ **Approve GCP Cloud Storage?** (~$35/month for Parquet archival)
  - ✅ **Approve 4-week timeline?** (80-100 hours effort)
  - ✅ **Start immediately or defer?** (Blocks multi-intersection support)
  - ⏳ **GCP project setup?** (Need to create GCP account/project)

**Recommendation:** Approve and start immediately. Current Parquet-only architecture cannot scale beyond 1-2 intersections efficiently.

**Benefits:**
- 10-100x faster API queries
- Support for 100+ intersections
- Spatial queries (proximity, routing, heatmaps)
- Production-ready cloud storage
- Automated data lifecycle management

**Risks:** Managed with dual-write, feature flags, validation, and rollback plan

---

### 2. **Data Integration Roadmap Approval** (Deferred)
- **Status**: Roadmap complete, deferred until after PostgreSQL migration
- **Document**: `memory-bank/data-integration-roadmap.md`
- **Key Decisions Needed**:
  - ⏸️ Deferred - PostgreSQL migration takes priority
  - Will revisit after database migration complete

**Proposed Architecture**:
- Pluggable data source framework (abstract interface + registry)
- Configurable feature definitions (YAML-based)
- Dynamic feature engine (compute from config, not code)
- Admin UI for data source management and weight tuning
- A/B testing framework for index formulas

**Proposed New Data Sources** (Phase 3):
1. Weather API (OpenWeatherMap) - precipitation, visibility, temperature
2. VDOT Crash Data - historical crashes for validation
3. Traffic Volume API - additional traffic metrics

### 2. **Configuration Storage Strategy**
- **Question**: Database vs. files vs. hybrid approach?
- **Recommendation**: Hybrid - files for defaults, database for runtime changes
- **Impact**: Affects admin UI implementation and deployment

### 3. **Admin UI Technology Choice**
- **Options**:
  - React + TypeScript (full-featured, production-grade)
  - Streamlit (rapid prototyping, Python-native)
  - Vue.js (lighter weight alternative)
- **Recommendation**: React for production quality, Streamlit for MVP/prototype
- **Decision Needed**: Start with MVP or go straight to production UI?

### 4. **Empirical Bayes Implementation** (Deferred)
- **Current Status**: Skipped due to data structure mismatch
- **Decision**: Keep as backlog item or redesign baseline data structure?
- **Impact**: Low - raw indices are still meaningful
- **Recommendation**: Address in Phase 2 or 3 of roadmap

### 5. **PSM Data Scarcity** (Monitoring)
- **Observation**: Only 21 PSM messages vs 1,678 BSM
- **Question**: Is this normal or a collection issue?
- **Investigation Needed**: Check VCC API coverage for pedestrian-heavy areas
- **Impact**: Low - system works with BSM-only data
- **Action**: Continue monitoring, investigate if needed

### 6. **Production Deployment** (Future)
- **Current**: Running on localhost
- **Needed**: Cloud deployment strategy (AWS, Azure, GCP?)
- **Timeline**: After roadmap Phase 4-5 (admin UI complete)
- **Considerations**:
  - Scaling data collection
  - Database choice (keep PostgreSQL or switch to TimescaleDB?)
  - Caching strategy (Redis vs alternatives)
  - Monitoring and alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)

---

## What's Unclear?

### Mathematical Formulas - ✅ RESOLVED

~~Some of the math is still a little foggy~~ → **NOW CLEAR!**

**Implemented Formulas:**

1. **VRU Safety Index**:
   ```
   I_VRU = (I_VRU_raw × w1) + (V × w2) + (σ_v × w3)
   Where: I_VRU_raw, V, σ_v are normalized values
   ```

2. **Vehicle Safety Index**:
   ```
   I_vehicle = (I_vehicle_raw × w4) + (V × w5) + (Δθ × w6) + (S × w7)
   ```

3. **Combined Index**:
   ```
   Combined_Index = I_VRU + I_vehicle
   ```

4. **Normalization** (working correctly):
   ```
   I_max = max(incident_rates)
   V_max = max(vehicle_volumes)
   σ_max = max(speed_variances)
   S_ref = reference_speed
   ```

5. **Empirical Bayes** (pending):
   ```
   Adjusted_Index = λ × Raw_Index + (1-λ) × Baseline
   Where λ = N / (N + k)
   ```

### Remaining Technical Questions

1. **Conflict Detection Thresholds**
   - Current: Using default proximity thresholds
   - Question: What are optimal thresholds for different road types?
   - Impact: Medium (affects conflict detection accuracy)

2. **Temporal Aggregation**
   - Current: 15-minute intervals (historical), 1-minute (real-time)
   - Question: Are these intervals optimal?
   - Observation: 15-min seems good for statistical significance

3. **Index Interpretation**
   - Current: Numeric scores (33.44, etc.)
   - Question: What do these numbers mean to end users?
   - Need: Categorization (safe/moderate/dangerous) or percentile ranking

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. Empirical Bayes Adjustment - Skipped
**Issue**: Baseline event data structure mismatch (missing 'hour_of_day' column)

**Status**: Non-blocking - using raw indices

**Workaround**: Raw safety indices are mathematically sound and meaningful

**Future Fix**: Restructure baseline data or redesign EB calculation

### 2. Limited PSM Data
**Issue**: Only 21 PSM messages collected vs 1,678 BSM

**Status**: Expected - likely no pedestrians in monitoring area

**Impact**: VRU conflict detection has limited data

**Workaround**: System works with BSM-only data

### 3. Windows Path Mangling (Git Bash)
**Issue**: Git Bash converts Unix paths to Windows paths

**Status**: Known platform limitation

**Workaround**: Prefix all Docker commands with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`

**Example**:
```bash
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker exec trafficsafety-collector ls /app/data/parquet
```

## Team Knowledge

### Key Learning: Feature Engineering with Time Intervals
**Challenge**: Real-time (1-min) and historical (15-min) intervals caused column name conflicts

**Solution**: Standardize to 'time_15min' for downstream compatibility while supporting variable intervals:
```python
time_col_name = f'time_{interval_minutes}min'
features.rename(columns={'time_interval': time_col_name}, inplace=True)

# Standardize for compatibility
if time_col_name != 'time_15min':
    features['time_15min'] = features[time_col_name]
```

### Key Learning: Docker Volume Persistence
**Issue**: Data lost on container restart

**Solution**: Named volumes in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - parquet_data:/app/data/parquet
```

### Key Learning: Windows Docker Commands
**Issue**: Git Bash mangles paths

**Solution**: Always use `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` prefix
